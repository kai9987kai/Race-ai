# Race-ai 🏁🤖

**Race-ai** is an experimental Python project exploring an AI agent that learns to get past obstacles and reach the finish as fast as possible.

> Repo tagline: “Ai learning to get past obsticles to the finsih in the fasted way”

## Project goals

- Build a simple “race to the finish” task with obstacles.
- Train an agent to improve over time (e.g., by learning from trial-and-error and/or feedback).
- Optimize for **finishing quickly** while **avoiding obstacles**.

This is an early-stage project and currently lives as a small, single-entrypoint prototype.
